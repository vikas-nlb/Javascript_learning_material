//For loop is a programming language conditional iterative statement which is used to check for certain conditions and then repeatedly execute a block of code as long as those conditions are met.

//The for loop is distinguished from other looping statements through an explicit loop counter or loop variable which allows the body of the loop to know the exact sequencing of each iteration.

//The main difference between for loop and while loop is that in for loop the number of iterations to be done is already known and is used to obtain a certain result whereas in while loop the command runs until a certain condition is reached and the statement is proved to be false.

var projects = ["Retail", "Whitelabel", "Sme", "Masspay", "Baas"];
console.log("For loop");
for (let i = 0; i < projects.length; i++) {
  console.log(friends[i]);
}
