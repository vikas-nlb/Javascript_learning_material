//The this keyword refers to an object.
// Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).

// The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:
// In an object method, this refers to the object.
// Alone, this refers to the global object.
// In a function, this refers to the global object.
// In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
// In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
// Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.
